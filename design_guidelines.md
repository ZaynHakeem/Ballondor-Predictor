# Ballon d'Or Predictor - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from professional sports analytics platforms (FiveThirtyEight, Opta, ESPN Stats) combined with modern data visualization apps (Linear, Observable). The design balances sports excitement with analytical credibility, creating a premium prediction platform that feels both authoritative and engaging.

**Core Design Principles**:
- Data clarity over decoration - let predictions and insights shine
- Confident, professional sports analytics aesthetic
- Hierarchical information architecture for complex ML outputs
- Responsive precision - charts and tables must work perfectly on mobile

2. Top predictions leaderboard (primary content)
3. Detailed player analysis (drill-down content)
4. Model explanations (educational/transparency content)

**Typography Hierarchy**:
- Use font weight variation (400â†’600â†’800) more than size
- Maintain consistent line-height (leading-relaxed for body, leading-tight for headings)
- Strategic color contrast for emphasis (primary text for key data, muted for labels)

**Spatial Hierarchy**:
- Generous whitespace around key prediction results
- Tighter spacing within related stat groups
- Clear visual separation between prediction and explanation sections
